# Exponential-Random-Graph-Model-for-Neural-Microcircuits

This repository contains data and codes used for the analysis of the master's thesis project. The project focused on the investigation of some machine learning models for networks (called Exponential Random Graph Models) for the understanding of brain networks on a cellular scale and the generation of new networks with the same topological properties. For code reproduction and analysis ask me for the data via my email address
